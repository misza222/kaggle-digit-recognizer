kaggle-digit-recognizer
=======================

Employing various Machine Learning algorithms and Python to solve kaggle's
[Digits Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/) exercise.

This is just for practice and for me getting familiar with Python and
implementations of linear regression, neural networks, SVG's ... in Python.

Computing in the cloud
======================
If you are interested in running python learning algorithms in the cloud, please
take a look at the
[Machine Learning Chef Recipe](https://github.com/misza222/chef-ml-python)
and help with improving it.
